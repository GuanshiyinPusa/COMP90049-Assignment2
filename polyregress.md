### Feature Engineering
Six new features were engineered based on domain knowledge of used car pricing. Mileage_per_year (calculated as car_mileage / car_age, with values clipped at 50,000 km/year) captures usage intensity, as heavily-driven vehicles may depreciate differently than those with similar total mileage accumulated over more years. Is_Luxury is a binary indicator for luxury brands (Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Porsche, Tesla, Jaguar, Land Rover), capturing premium pricing independent of specifications. HP_per_Liter (engine horsepower / engine capacity) represents engine efficiency, distinguishing high-performance engines from larger but less efficient ones. Age_Mileage_Ratio (car_age / (car_mileage/1000 + 1)) indicates whether a vehicle sat unused versus being actively driven. Brand_Mean and Model_Mean are smoothed mean-encoded values capturing brand and model-specific pricing effects while preventing overfitting on rare categories. After encoding all categorical variables, the final feature set contained 21 variables.

### Model Description
Polynomial regression was implemented as a scikit-learn Pipeline with three stages: (1) PolynomialFeatures generates all degree-2 polynomial terms with include_bias=False, expanding the 21 base features to 252 polynomial and interaction terms, (2) RobustScaler normalizes features using median and IQR to remain resistant to outliers, and (3) LinearRegression fits coefficients via ordinary least squares. The model was trained on 27,948 observations and evaluated on a held-out test set of 6,988 observations. Additionally, 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training set to obtain robust performance estimates.

Research Question 1: Which ML model is the most accurate for this data?
Polynomial regression achieved strong predictive performance with a test set MAE of $179,653 and R² of 0.905, explaining 90.5% of variance in used car prices. The 5-fold cross-validation produced consistent results with mean MAE of $180,929 (± $2,832), indicating stable generalization across different training subsets. The close agreement between test MAE and cross-validation MAE suggests the model's performance is reliable and not dependent on a particular train-test split.
Figure 1 shows the actual vs predicted prices, where predictions closely track the diagonal reference line across the full price range with tight clustering around the ideal prediction line. This visual confirmation demonstrates the model's accuracy across all price segments. Figure 3 compares training and test performance across three metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²), revealing minimal difference between training (MAE=$167,421, R²=0.918) and test performance (MAE=$179,653, R²=0.905). This small gap suggests minimal overfitting despite the 252-feature space, validating our preprocessing approach and indicating the model generalizes well to unseen data rather than merely memorizing training patterns.
Figure 2 (residual plot) reveals residuals centered around zero with no systematic patterns, confirming the model is well-specified without bias across the price range. However, residual variance increases slightly at higher predicted prices, indicating mild heteroscedasticity where the model is less precise for luxury vehicles. Figure 4 shows the error distribution is approximately normal with mean near zero (mean=-$5,442, std=$254,215), confirming unbiased predictions on average. The slight positive skew indicates occasional large underpredictions, but the overall symmetric distribution validates the model's reliability.
Compared to simpler linear models that our team evaluated preliminarily (which achieved R²≈0.826), the polynomial regression's 90.5% R² represents a substantial improvement, demonstrating that capturing non-linear relationships and feature interactions is critical for accurate price prediction in this dataset.

Research Question 2: What models retain their value over higher mileage?
The polynomial regression model's ability to capture interaction effects makes it ideal for addressing this question. The interaction terms between mileage and other features reveal how depreciation patterns vary across different vehicle types.
The car_mileage linear coefficient is -$774,000, indicating substantial usage-based depreciation. However, the full story emerges through interaction terms. The Age_Mileage_Ratio feature and its interactions capture whether vehicles depreciate differently based on usage intensity versus time. A high Age_Mileage_Ratio (old car with low mileage) versus low ratio (newer car with high mileage) can signal different depreciation trajectories—cars that sit unused may suffer from neglect-related issues, while heavily-used cars demonstrate durability.
The Model_Mean feature, when interacted with mileage in the polynomial terms, reveals which specific models maintain value despite high usage. The large interaction coefficient for car_engine_hp × Model_Mean (-$1,524k) and car_engine_capacity × Model_Mean (+$1,491k) suggests that model reputation significantly moderates how technical specifications affect price. High-performance models from reputable manufacturers likely retain value better at higher mileage because buyers trust their build quality and durability.
The Is_Luxury interactions indicate that luxury vehicles depreciate differently with mileage. The Is_Luxury² term (-$1,216k) combined with the linear Is_Luxury term (-$1,216k) suggests luxury vehicles experience accelerated depreciation, though this effect is complex because luxury premiums are primarily captured through Brand_Mean and Model_Mean rather than the binary flag.
Figure 6 provides empirical evidence by showing prediction error across price ranges. Mean absolute error increases systematically from approximately $80,000 for very low-priced vehicles to $350,000 for very high-priced vehicles. This pattern suggests that higher-priced vehicles (which tend to be luxury models) show greater price variability and less predictable depreciation patterns with mileage—their value retention depends more heavily on specific model reputation, condition, and buyer preferences rather than following consistent depreciation curves.
The Mileage_per_year feature's interactions capture whether intensive usage (high annual mileage) affects value differently than accumulated mileage over many years. Combined with the car_age × car_mileage interaction term in the polynomial expansion, the model can represent whether depreciation accelerates or decelerates as both age and mileage increase—revealing that certain models maintain value when usage is distributed over time versus concentrated in fewer years.

Research Question 3: What factors affect the price more than others?
Feature importance analysis reveals which characteristics most strongly influence used car pricing. Figure 5 displays the top 10 original features (excluding polynomial and interaction terms) ranked by absolute coefficient magnitude, providing clear insights into the most important pricing factors.
Engine horsepower emerges as the single most important technical specification with a coefficient of +$1,387,000, indicating that buyers place the highest premium on power. This directly answers RQ3 by identifying raw performance as the dominant technical factor affecting price. Each additional horsepower unit adds substantial value, making engine power the primary differentiator among vehicles with similar other characteristics.
Model_Mean (-$412,000) and Brand_Mean (+$420,000) demonstrate that reputation effects significantly impact pricing. The Brand_Mean positive coefficient shows that brand prestige provides a consistent premium across vehicle configurations. However, Model_Mean's negative standalone coefficient combined with its large positive interaction terms (e.g., +$1,491k with engine capacity) indicates model effects are highly context-dependent—certain models only command premiums when paired with appropriate specifications. This suggests buyers value specific model reputations differently depending on the vehicle's configuration.
Car_mileage shows a substantial negative coefficient (-$774,000), confirming that usage-based depreciation is a major pricing factor. This validates the intuitive expectation that heavily-used vehicles command lower prices, with each additional 1,000 km reducing value by approximately $774.
Transmission type significantly affects pricing, with Transmission_automatic (-$638,000) and Transmission_robot (-$593,000) showing large negative coefficients. This indicates manual transmission (the reference category) commands a premium in this market, possibly reflecting demand for sports cars or market-specific preferences in the Russian used car market where driving engagement may be valued over convenience.
Is_Luxury shows a large negative coefficient (-$1,216,000), which initially appears counterintuitive. However, this reflects that luxury premiums are primarily captured through Brand_Mean and Model_Mean encodings—the negative coefficient on the binary luxury flag suggests it provides little additional information once brand and model effects are accounted for. The coefficient might also reflect that luxury vehicles depreciate faster, offsetting their initial premium when controlling for brand and model reputation.
Car_engine_capacity shows a negative coefficient (-$1,058,000), which seems contradictory until considering the interaction terms. The negative main effect combined with positive interactions (car_engine_capacity × Model_Mean: +$1,491k) suggests that engine capacity alone doesn't add value—it only matters in specific models where larger engines are expected and valued. In economy cars, larger engines may signal inefficiency without performance benefits, while in luxury or sports models, they indicate desirable power.
HP_per_Liter has a negative coefficient (-$525,000), suggesting that engine efficiency (power per liter of displacement) is valued less than raw power. Buyers appear to prefer absolute performance over efficient power delivery, indicating that larger, less efficient engines command premiums over smaller, more efficient ones producing similar power.
Among the top 15 overall features (including polynomial terms), interaction effects dominate. The strongest terms include car_engine_hp × Model_Mean (-$1,524k), car_engine_capacity × car_engine_hp (-$1,520k), and car_engine_capacity × Model_Mean (+$1,491k). These large interaction coefficients confirm that feature combinations drive pricing more than individual features alone—the effect of engine specifications depends heavily on the specific model, with high-performance engines adding more value in sports/luxury models than in economy cars.
The quadratic term car_engine_hp² (+$1,119k) reveals important non-linearity: the marginal value of horsepower increases at higher power levels. A 50 HP increase matters more for a 350 HP sports car than for a 100 HP economy car, indicating that high-performance vehicles appreciate disproportionately with additional power. This non-linearity explains why polynomial regression outperforms linear models—the relationship between horsepower and price is fundamentally curved rather than linear.
In summary, RQ3 is answered definitively: engine horsepower is the most important single factor affecting price, followed by brand and model reputation, mileage, and transmission type. However, the dominance of interaction terms reveals that pricing is fundamentally context-dependent—the value of any single feature depends critically on how it combines with other vehicle characteristics, particularly model reputation and complementary technical specifications.
